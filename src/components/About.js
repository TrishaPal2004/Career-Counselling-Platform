In today's dynamic world, making informed career choices is more crucial than ever for students. Unfortunately, many young people and their families in India are unaware of the diverse career opportunities available, often making choices based on limited information or societal pressures. This can lead to mismatched skills, job dissatisfaction, and even unemployment.</div>
